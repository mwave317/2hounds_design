      <p>Terms and Conditions</p>
      
      <p>We sincerely appreciate your business and want your experience with 2
         Hounds Design to be positive. We hope that you will be pleased with the
          products you receive. Please allow up to 14 days during the busy
           season for your order to be made and shipped. If I can get it out
            before then, I promise I will! Because each item is custom made when
             you place your order, your credit card is charged at the time that
              you place your order.</p>
<p>Please understand that you are responsible for determining the appropriate
   size and width collar for your dog. Because we are making collars for dogs
    we can't see and don't know personally, we are not responsible if you order
     a 2" wide size small (10-15") collar for your 6 lb dog. It is up to you to
      order the correct size and width collar for your dog.</p>

<p>Please note that all orders are custom made when you place your order and
   therefore cannot be exchanged or returned. Even exchanges are offered in the
    case of a defect in materials or workmanship. If you receive your collar and
     there is a flaw, stain, defect, etc, (this is VERY rare) please contact me
      within 10 days and I will have you send the unused collar back to me - I
       will either issue a credit or an exchange. Normal wear and tear is not
        covered under this warranty.</p>

<p>If you order the wrong size, wrong color, wrong hardware width, etc, can NOT
   be refunded or exchanged. Therefore it is VERY important that you check your
    details carefully. The size guidelines offered are only guidelines and do
     not take the place of measuring your dog. If you are unsure about the size
      you need, please measure first!</p>
