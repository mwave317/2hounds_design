        <h1>Everything You Need to Know Before You Order</h1>

        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>When you place your order, please understand that we sew all dog
           collars and leashes custom to your specifications. It typically takes
            10-14 days to complete your order and get it in the mail to you. If
             we can get it finished and shipped before then, we promise we will!
              Because each order is custom made, your card will be charged at
               the time the order is placed.  Freedom Harnesses are usually in
                stock (most sizes/colors) and should ship within 3-5 days if
                 they are the only items on the order.</p>
                 <h4>Exchange/Return Policy</h4>

         <p>If you realize after placing your order that you ordered the wrong
            size, color, or design, contact us immediately and we will be happy
             to make the changes to your order before it is made.</p>

       <p>Please note: No used harnesses will be accepted for return or
          exchange. If you realize you have ordered the wrong size harness,
           you can exchange your unused harness for the correct size for the
            cost of shipping within 7 days of receipt.</p>

         <p>Every 2HD collar is custom made when you place your order.
            <strong>PLEASE</strong><Link to ="/measure"> measure your dog </Link>
             if you are unsure what size you need. If you receive your order
              and realize that you accidentally ordered the wrong size or width,
               your order can be exchanged for a $12 per collar fee, which
                covers the labor to create a new collar and the shipping charges
                 to send the collar back to you.</p>

         <p>Please Contact Us and you will be asked to send the <strong>NEW and
            UNUSED</strong> item(s) back to us along with a check or money order
             for the exchange fee. If you want to return any item(s) for a
              refund, we will refund you for the price of the <strong>NEW and
                 UNUSED</strong> item(s) less a 20% "restocking" fee.</p>
         <p><strong>We guarantee our construction, seams, and hardware and in
            the EXTREMELY rare case that you find a defect in construction,
             please <Link to="/contact">Contact Us</Link> immediately and we
              will replace your item at no cost to you.</strong></p>

         <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Normal wear and tear does not qualify as a
            construction defect and therefore does not qualify for exchanges
             or returns.</strong></p>

         <h4>What is Normal Wear and Tear?</h4>

 <p>Wear and tear will be different depending on the collar and how rough and
    tumble your dog is. If you have a heavy scratcher, mud roller, or rough
     playing dog, your collars will begin to show normal wear and tear faster
      than if you have a lap dog that sleeps all day. You are always welcome
       to Contact Us to ask about the durability of a collar you are considering
        for your dog.</p>

 <p><strong>Additional Advice</strong> - Wear and tear on your collar will be
  significantly reduced if you have more than one collar that you switch around
   on a regular basis. It will also be significantly reduced if you have a tag
    collar that is worn daily in the house and you save your designer dog
     collars for walks, visits, outtings, etc.This is the same concept of having
      different clothing for yourself for different activities.</p>

 <p>Imagine that you wear the same shirt and the same jeans every single day, 24
    hours per day. After 6 months of being worn every single day, both the shirt
     and the pants are going to start looking extremely worn and maybe not fit
      to be worn in public. If they were worn during extreme activity (exercise,
         gardening, etc) they will look worse than if they were worn while
          lounging around the house. You wouldn't garden in your ball gown or
           "dress up" clothes because they would get dirty and wear out
            faster.</p>
 <p><strong>You are welcome to <Link to="/contact">Contact Us</Link> for more
  information about how to preserve the life of your dog collar. We are happy
   to answer questions to the best of our ability based on how you describe
    your dog's activity level and daily life.</strong></p>

 <h4>Inspect Your Collars</h4>

 <p>Please inspect your dog collars frequently for signes of potential problems
    and to make sure that your dog has not chewed or scratched the
    collar.<strong> While we make sure every collar that is shipped is ready to
       keep your pooch safe, a well placed toenail can damage even the
        strongest seam and it is important that you determine the condition of
         each collar before using it.</strong></p>

 <p>Consumer assumes all responsibility for determining which collar is suitable
    for their situation. When you place your order, you acknowledge that you
     accept all responsibility while using 2 Hounds Design products.</p>

 <h4>Washing your 2 Hounds Design dog collar</h4>

 <p>With so many different fabrics to choose from, it is almost impossible to
    have uniform washing instructions. When in doubt, please contact us and ask
     for advice. Most silk brocades, cotton prints, and woven jacquards can be
      placed in a laundry bag or knotted pillowcase and washed in the washing
       machine. Allow it to air dry and your collar is good as new!</p>

 <p>Beaded collars or other very special collars should be spot treated with a
    Tide stick or other spot remover.</p>

 <h4>Sizing</h4>

 <p>If you aren’t 100% sure about what size dog collar you should order,
    PLEASE <Link to="/measure">measure your dog</Link>. It is important to
     remember that we make each collar custom when it is ordered, so if you fail
      to measure your dog and order the wrong size, there is a $12 fee to

       exchange the collar for the correct size. The general guidelines below do
        NOT take the place of measuring your dog, you should always measure to
         make sure you are ordering the correct size.</p>

<p>Martingale Dog Collars can be made in your choice of 1”, 1.5" or 2" and for
   the ribbons available in the XSmall collars section, 5/8" wide. Buckle
    Martingale Collars and Side Release Buckle Dog Collars are available in
     5/8”, 1” or 1.5” widths. <strong>The 2" wide hardware is significantly
        heavier than 1" and 1.5" hardware.</strong></p>



 <p>Italian Greyhounds and other very small breeds most often need an XSmall
    collar, which is adjustable from 7-11 inches. The very small breeds do best
     with a 5/8” or 1” wide Martingale Collar. I don’t recommend Buckle
      Martingale Collars for dogs this small because the buckle reduces the
       amount of adjustability.</p>

 <p>If you NEED a buckle martingale collar for your very small breed dog, I
   \ recommend that you stick with a 5/8” wide collar from our XSmall Collars
    collection.
 Whippets, Jack Russell Terrier, and other small/medium sized breeds most often
  need a size Small, which is adjustable from 10-14 inches. Whippets can wear a
   5/8”, 1”, or 1.5” wide collar because they have such long necks. Other
    small/medium sized breeds do best with 5/8” or 1” wide dog collars.</p>

 <p>Greyhounds, Saluki, Afghans, and other medium sized dogs will need a size
    Medium martingale dog collar, which is adjustable from 13-18 inches. Some
     larger greyhounds (80+ lbs) sometimes need a size Large martingale collar,
      which is adjustable from 15-20 inches. You will be able to determine this
       when you measure your dog’s neck.</p>

 <p>Large Greyhounds, smaller Labs, Golden Retrievers, and other large breed
    dogs most often need a size Large collar, which is adjustable from 15-20
     inches.</p>

 <p>Great Danes, larger Labs, and other very large breed dogs will definitely
    need measurements to determine the correct size. Some Danes can wear a size
     Large, some require an XLarge collar, it really depends on the size of your
      dog.</p>

 <p>If you have a dog whose neck is larger than XXLarge (26-34 inches) you will
    need to select “Specify” from the size menu and in the comments section of
     your order, specify the size needed in the comments section when you check
      out.</p>

            up to 10-14 days before your collar goes in the mail.</strong></p>
