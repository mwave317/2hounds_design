        <p> What is your Privacy Policy</p>

      <p>We value our customers' privacy and take seriously the trust you
         place in us. We do not sell, rent, or give away any customer
          information. This information is only used to contact you if we
           have questions about your order and to ship your order to you.</p>

      <p>What methods of payment do you accept?</p>
      <p>We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, and Paypal.
         We will also accept money orders or personal checks through the mail.
          If you send a personal check, your order will not ship until it
           clears.</p>
      <p>Do you ship internationally?</p>
      <p>Yes! I ship MANY packages overseas each week using Global Mail.
         Buyer will pay actual shipping costs. Please allow 4-10 days in the
          mail for international orders .</p>

          <p>How will you ship my order and how much is shipping?</p>
      <p>We use USPS for all mail inside the US or USPS Global Mail for
         international orders to ship your order. Delivery takes 2-3 days
          average to anywhere in the United States and the cost is $6.75 for
           up to 3 collars, add $1 shipping for each additional collar.
           Global Priority mail can take 4-10 days or longer, depending on
            whether the package gets stopped in customs. International shipping
             is calculated automatically on our website and ranges from $18.50+
              depending on the country.</p>

              <p>Can I wash my 2HD Martingale or Side Release Dog Collars?</p>
      <p>Yes! Unless otherwise noted, you can handwash your Martingale or Side
         Release collars in mild detergent OR you can wash them inside a
          lingerie bag (or knotted pillowcase) on the delicate cycle and let
           them air dry. Do Not let them dry in sunlight and do not store them
            in sunlight because UV rays will fade most fabric.</p>

            <p>How long will it take to receive my collar?</p>
      <p>We sew every 2HD collar custom when it is ordered, with so many options
         to choose from, we simply can't keep every collar in stock in every
          option.  It takes us 9-12 days to complete your order most of the
           time, however during the busiest times of the year, please allow a
            few extra days (September-December).</p>

      <p>What is your return policy?</p>

      <p>Our full return policy can be found here.</p>
